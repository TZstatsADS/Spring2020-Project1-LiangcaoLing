### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2020

+ Projec title: Analysis of change in Rock and Pop music during 40 years
+ This project is conducted by Liangcao Ling

+ Project summary: This project focuses on sentiment analysis and topic modelling on two most popular music genres - Rock and Pop. The data is grouped by year to observe how emotion and topics change over time. First, I use sentiment analysis and observe that Pop music has a lower proportion of negative songs than Rock music through history. Then, I use topic modelling on sampled data. The result shows that adjacent years tend to cluster together and the topics gradually change from 1990s to 2000s.
